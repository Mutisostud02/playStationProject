        <h1>Playstation Open Tournament Nairobi.</h1>
        <p class="expl"> I am suggesting an idea that will bring top gamers from around the country together in one place.</p>
        <p>The idea is to create this website that enables registration to a tournament which will be held at Nairobi cbd.</p>
        <p>Gamers are to pay a certain amount to enter into the tournament with the chance of winning a certain amount of cash should he or she reach the finals of the tournament.</p>
